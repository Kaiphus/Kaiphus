- 👋 Hi, I’m @Todd
- 👀 I’m interested in building up my skills to become a software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on very simple projects at the moment.  My skills are subpar and I would never willingly drag down or make work for others.
- 📫 How to reach me use my email kirby12333@outlook.com
